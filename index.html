            <p>Well... I don't know man, I have nothing to say so I am just saying things.</p>

            <p>A number guessing game : the program chooses a random number from 1 to 100, and then you will need to guess it in 5 trys.</p>
            <p>I don't think I am gonna begin right away, however I am gonna make sure that I actually do it.</p>
            <p>Also you might ask : Why are talking so much in english? I am just more comfortable with it.</p>
