            <p>Ah, un paragraphe inutile qui fait que perdre votre temps. Je ne sais meme pas pourquoi vous etes la.</p>
            <p>Peut-etre vous voulait lire quelque chose d'interessant, peut-etre vous etes le professeur en train de corriger.</p>
            <p>Si vous etes le professeur, ce dernier paragraphe est encore plus inutile.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I didn't know what to say, so uh... yeah. Anyway, I am just writing things.</p>
            <p>I suppose I could say that it's been 5 years since I first started coding.</p>
            <p>I first started, I believe with some html/css and php, but I quickly switched to python, and after some time i began to play with game engines like Unity and Godot.</p>
            <p>And then lately I decided to learn C++ and to use SFML for a game I am working on.</p>
            <p>You might also ask : Why are talking so much in english? Well, I am more comfortable with it.</p>
